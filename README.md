cd complainiler;

u have to run python shell.py and then a basic terminal will open
then u have to run this command  RUN("example.myopl") it will execute whatever it is written in the basic.myopl file

it first uses a parser to read each character of the basic.myopl file and then tokenizes it i have used a language similar to BASIC to compile
